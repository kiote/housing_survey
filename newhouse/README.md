## Intro

This project imports data from American Housing Survey (AHS) to MySQL database.

## Import data

to be able to import data, you should put data file into the

```
data/non-git
```

folder. For example, newhouse.csv should be putted into

```
data/non-git/puf2013/newhouse.csv
```

Since github can't hold such a big files, this manual step exists.
