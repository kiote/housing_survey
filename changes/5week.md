## 5 week progress

Although previous week plan was to add some other year, I finished with 2013 year (again), but with National, not Metropolitan data.
As we found this National data more useful than Metropolitan. 

Also more indexes where added to DB and documentation was bit organized. 

I didn't add any by-year index, as I want to do it when new year will be (finally) added.

## 6 week plan

Get another year (earlier?) and save same data.
