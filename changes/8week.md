## 8 week progress

This week was addicted to 2007 year. Data from 2007 national data files had been added
to the MySQL database.

## Problems

There was a question about almost 3 times more data in 2011 tables.
I've made pretty small research on that topic and added it's result to wiki.
Meanwhile this question transforms to other: how we can separate National data
from 2011 data.

## 9 week plan

To import 2005 year.
