## Week 2 Progress

### Auto-generation of the data type of the newhouse fields.

 First I was thinking about some manual process for matching fields with its datatypes and lost some time there.
 After I've created system, which gets data-file (original CSV from AHS) and generates datatypes from this file.

 What I suggested before:

 > So only manual step I'll need then is to create this csv files for all models with "field name – field type – params" inside.

 not true anymore (this step is also automatized).

 This is done for Newhouse table, also all data from newhouse.csv imported (2013 year).

 All next model would be generated with same idea.


## Week 3 Plan

 Going to finish with 2013 year for Metropolitan Summary Tables.
