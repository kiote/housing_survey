## 4 week progress

* More detailed documentation for each table added. 
I've lost some time trying to generate by-field documentation for every table, but then fall back to the Codebook-reference.
  
  You can read documentation [here](https://github.com/kiote/housing_survey#tables-description)
  
## 5 week plan

Get another year (earlier?) and save same data.
